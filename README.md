## About this project

### The idea of `Foodents`
We are first-year students in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Manchester. We come from different countries and cultures, but what brought us together was our commmon inability to keep up with a good meal schedule during term time. Not to mention the fact that we had to frequently self-isolate which left us with very limited ingredients in our kitchen. We decided to build a solution that would help not only just us, but also other students like us.
