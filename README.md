# Cookbook-10120-X9---Foodents


<Strong><font color=red size = 12>The easiest and safest way to savour delicious food during these unfortunate times!</font></Strong>

### The idea of `Foodents`
We are first-year students in the `Department of Computer Science` at the `University of Manchester`. We come from different countries and cultures, but what brought us together was our commmon inability to keep up with a good meal schedule during term time. Not to mention the fact that we had to frequently self-isolate which left us with very limited ingredients in our kitchen. We decided to build a solution that would help not only just us, but also other students like us.
