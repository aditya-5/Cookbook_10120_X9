Baked Shrimp Scampi:

- Servings: 6

- Ingredients:

    2\/3 cup panko
    1\/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
    1\/2 lemon, zested and juiced
    1 extra-large egg yolk
    1 teaspoon rosemary, minced
    3 tablespoon parsley, minced
    4 clove garlic, minced
    1\/4 cup shallots, minced
    8 tablespoon unsalted butter, at room temperature
    2 tablespoon dry white wine
    Freshly ground black pepper
    Kosher salt
    3 tablespoon olive oil
    2 pound frozen shrimp

- Instructions: 
	Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.



Defrost shrimp by putting in cold water, drain. Place the shrimp in serving dish (9x13in or 2 quart casserole) and toss gently with the olive oil, wine, 1 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Allow to sit at room temperature while you make the butter and garlic mixture.



In a small bowl, mash the softened butter with the garlic, shallots, parsley, rosemary, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, lemon juice, egg yolk, panko, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper until combined.



Spread the butter mixture evenly over the shrimp. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until hot and bubbly. If you like the top browned, place under a broiler for 1-3 minutes (keep an eye on it). Serve with lemon wedges and French bread.



Note: if using fresh shrimp, arrange for presentation. Starting from the outer edge of a 14-inch oval gratin dish, arrange the shrimp in a single layer cut side down with the tails curling up and towards the center of the dish. Pour the remaining marinade over the shrimp. 

- Story (for many of them, it's just details and alternatives):

	Modified by reducing butter and salt.  Substituted frozen shrimp instead of fresh 12-15 count (butterflied, tails on).

Spaetzle:

- Servings: 4

- Ingredients:

    2 teaspoon fresh parsley, chopped
    1 teaspoon garlic, minced
    3 tablespoon butter
    1 pinch nutmeg
    1\/4 teaspoon baking powder
    1 teaspoon salt
    1\/2 cup milk
    1 1\/2 cup flour, sifted
    2 eggs, slightly beaten
    2 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan, plus extra for garnish
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper

- Instructions:

	Bring a saucepan of salted water it a boil, reduce the heat, and maintain a simmer. In a bowl, stir all the ingredients together (eggs, flour, milk, salt, baking powder, and nutmeg). Place a colander over the pan, pour about1/4 of the batter into the colander, and press through the holes with a plastic spatula into the hot water. When the spatzle starts to float to the surface, cover the pan and keep covered until the spatzle appears to swell and is fluffy. Remove the dumplings and repeat the procedure with the remaining batter.



In a medium saute pan, add butter, and melt over medium heat until butter turns a light brown. Add garlic and cook until it becomes lightly colored. Add spaetzle to the pan to heat through. Add parsley, cheese, salt and pepper, to taste.

Pot Roast Carbonnade: 

- Servings: 6

- Ingredients:

    1\/2 pound bacon, cut into large lardons
    2 medium onions, sliced
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
    1 tablespoon vegetable oil
    1 1\/2 pound beef chuck, cut into large cubes
    5 carrots, peeled and cut into large chunks
    1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
    12 ounce beer (dark or light)
    6 prunes
    1 tablespoon dried thyme
    1 cup beef stock

- Instructions: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.



	In a large Dutch oven over medium-low heat, add the bacon and cook until it renders its fat and almost becomes crispy. Remove it with a slotted spoon to a plate. Add the onions, season with salt and pepper, to taste, and cook over low heat until they are deep in color and caramelized, about 30 minutes.



Remove the onions to a plate, leaving as much fat in the pot as possible. Add the vegetable oil and mix it with the bacon fat. Raise the heat to high. Season the beef liberally with salt and pepper and sear, in batches, until nicely browned on both sides.



Once the meat is browned, add the first batch of meat back to the pan along with the onions, carrots and bacon. Sprinkle in the flour and stir. Cook for 1 minute before deglazing the pan with the beer. Add the remaining ingredients and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pot and put it in the oven to braise until the beef is tender, about 2 hours. Remove the pot from the oven and transfer the pot roast to a serving dish.

Godiva Dark Chocolate Cheesecake:

- Servings: 10

- Ingredients:

    2 1\/2 cup cream cheese, room temperature
    1\/2 cup sugar
    1 3\/4 tablespoon cocoa powder
    5 tablespoon Godiva 85% Dark Chocolate Callets
    2 eggs
    2 egg yolks
    1 3\/4 tablespoon crème faiche

- Instructions: 

	In a food processor with a blade attachment, cream the cheese until smooth and then add in sugar. Pulse a couple times to incorporate sugar and cocoa powder. Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr�me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10" x 10" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.



Once the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1�" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.

Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits:

- Servings: 12

- Ingredients:

    8 tablespoon unsalted butter, cold, lightly floured and cut into 1\/8-inch slices
    2 tablespoon vegetable shortening, cut into 1\/2-inch chunks
    1 teaspoon salt
    1 tablespoon baking powder
    1\/2 teaspoon baking soda
    2 1\/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
    2 tablespoon butter, melted
    1 1\/4 cup buttermilk, cold

- Instructions: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position; heat oven to 450 degrees.  



Whisk flour, baking power, baking soda, and salt in large bowl.



Add shortening to flour mixture; break up chunks with fingertips until only pea-sized pieces remain.  Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.



Spray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.



Pat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.



Roll dough into 10-inch square about 1/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.



Brush biscuit tops with melted butter.  Bake, without opening oven door, until tops are golden brown and crisp, 15 to 17 minutes.  Let cool on baking sheet 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
